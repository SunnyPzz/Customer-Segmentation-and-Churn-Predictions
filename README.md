# Video Streaming Service Customer Segmentation and Churn Predictions
leveraging data science techniques to identify key factors influencing Netflix customer behavior and retention

# Project Overview
This project applies data science techniques to analyze customer churn and segmentation in the context of a video streaming service. Using the comprehensive dataset from Netflix, we aim to identify key factors driving customer churn and group customers into meaningful segments.

# Data Description
The Netflix dataset includes various customer attributes:
Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Number of Dependents.

Geographical Details: City, Zip Code, Coordinates.

Service Usage: Internet Service Type, Streaming Preferences.

Financial Data: Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Payment Methods.

Customer Status: Churned or Stayed.

# Key Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Assess data quality, handle missing values/outliers, and normalize features.

Customer Segmentation: Use clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups.

Churn Prediction: Develop models to predict customer churn and evaluate their performance.

Strategic Recommendations: Based on model insights, recommend strategies to reduce churn.

# Technologies and Models:
Python, Jupyter Notebooks
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
K-Means Clustering, PCA, Logistic Regression
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
